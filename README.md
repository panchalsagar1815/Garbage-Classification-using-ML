# Garbage-Classification-using-ML



Project Description:
The "Garbage Classification using Computer Vision" project is a cutting-edge initiative that employs advanced image recognition techniques to enhance waste management processes. Focused on addressing environmental concerns, the project utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) and data augmentation methods to classify images of various types of garbage, including plastic, paper, glass, trash, metal, and cardboard.

The core objective of this project is to develop a robust and accurate model capable of automatically categorizing waste items, thereby facilitating efficient recycling and disposal practices. Leveraging convolutional neural networks enables the system to learn intricate features from the provided garbage images, while data augmentation enhances the model's generalization by introducing variations in the training dataset.

By incorporating machine learning and computer vision, this project aims to contribute to sustainable waste management solutions. The model's ability to classify garbage items accurately can be utilized in real-world scenarios, such as smart waste bins, automated sorting systems, and environmental monitoring applications.

Through the integration of convolutional models and data augmentation techniques, the "Garbage Classification using Computer Vision" project strives to make a positive impact on waste management practices, promoting a more environmentally conscious and sustainable approach to handling different types of waste materials.
